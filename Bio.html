    <h1>Pancho's Bio</h1>
    <p>
      Originally from Cholula, Puebla, I was raised in Los Angeles, California. I was taught Spanish with a belt and
      bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a bi-cultural, highly motivated individual, self taught in a range of computer skills. My passions in life
      are Security, Networking, Linux, Programming, web-development, Complex Systems and AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      I discovered my love for creative problem solving during my time at Intel resolving arduous technical issues and
      was thrilled to be able to apply that to programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a software Developer I feel comfortable with React, VueJS, jquery, nodejs/express, neo4j, mongoDB, SQL, kafka,
      Github workflows, Kubernetes and Docker. I love collaborating and helping others in order to build beautiful
      software.
