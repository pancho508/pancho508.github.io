    <h1>Pancho's Bio</h1>
    <p>When humans experience hardship or trauma, they often shut down and descend into chaos. However, those with
      courage persevere. My parents, who walked barefoot as children, taught me to fight. I live my life not for glory
      nor riches but to help myself and those around me live; safe, complete, peaceful, and fulfilling lives.</p>
    <p>My family immigrated to the US in the late 90s due to economic reasons. I was raised in a conservative Mexican
      family with a father working seven days a week and a mother who disciplined her children with a belt and a Bible.
      During my childhood, I was not allowed to leave home, so my computer became my best friend. Those were the good
      old days when MP3s took 20 minutes to download, and 39 people from around the world would gather on Sundays to
      slay mythical monsters in World of Warcraft.</p>
    <p>Work was highly valued by my parents, and my first entrepreneurial venture began in middle school, selling
      candies to classmates. I worked various jobs, from selling “elotes” (sweet corn) on the street to construction
      work. Unfortunately, as an illegal alien, I felt excluded from white-collar jobs and a college education. I
      voluntarily repatriated to Mexico, where I found both challenges and freedom.</p>
