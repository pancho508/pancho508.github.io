    <h1>Extra - Why programming? </h1>
    <p>I did not have much interest to program during my youth.</p>
    <p>However, last year while surfing the internet I read Complexity: A Guided Tour by Melanie Mitchell by coincidence I was also playing a game called Nier Automata.</p>
    <p>I had done a few tinkering projects on my pc with AI but nothing solid nor concrete. However, after finishing both the book and the game. There was a fire in me to learn everything I could about this beautiful unknown that is complexity.</p>
    <p>In reaching that goal I am prepared to sacrifice everything. HolaCode is helping me take that first step.</p>
