      <p>On my first year in highschool must have been like 14, I had 4 months a year off as we had 3 tracks.</p>
      <p>On the first day of vacation my mom told me if I was going to be lazy the next few months like a pregnant pig</p>
      <p>or if I was going to do something with my life. I didnt know how to find a job. She said not to worry as ppl would come to the house JUST to offer me a job.</p>
      <p>So I ended up going to downtown on my bicycle and after asking 3 places they told me no but he knew of someone.</p>
      <p>Ended up getting a job and got to eat persion food everyday. He paid me 30 dollars a day. </p>
